1. A question within the context of this lab assignment.
- My map rendered in the preview and in the live server and now it isn't working I don't get it. I'm really frustrated. I'm taking a loss on this lab. I'm tired....
1. An observation about the lab assignment, or related ‘Ah-hah!’ moment.
- There has to be a better way to debug, why am I being shown that things are working when they dont. CSS is still so confusing.

### Reflections and Comments

1. A link to the deployed version of your latest code.
1. A link to your public Trello board.
1. A question within the context of this lab assignment.
    - I don't understand how to get localhost working to debug. I'm collecting server errors like pokemon cards like what "hundreds" number am I going to get next...
1. An observation about the lab assignment, or related ‘Ah-hah!’ moment.
    - I had an ah-hah moment when Brandon showed me how to get local host to work but then I forgot... I thought it was a plug and chug lab since we already written the weather function yesterday, but wow it's so complicated. 
1. How long you spent working on this assignment.
    - 9 hours and I'm still not done. I stayed up till 6:30am to finish lab07 and I have a feeling I will tonight as well. 



  <!-- 
  local host issue fixes
  lsof -i :3000 = error address already in use
  kill -9 <PID>
  npx kill-port 3000 -->





    - How can I remember what changes in one file and where the effects the changes can connect to  and make those changes when refactoring? is it better to start at the last child and work up to app? Like city form affects weather, movies, and map do i just start with one of those three? I find that when I do that sometimes certain words get changed and then i get lost on where else to change those.  
1. An observation about the lab assignment, or related ‘Ah-hah!’ moment.
    - Sometimes I feel like I get where things connect or calls to where and then I confuse myself because I'm not sure if I don't actually get it or I'm overthinking it. But an ah-hah moment was when I spent some time today finishing lab 8 and I found server side to be a lot easier to refactor.

    - 7 hours and I'm still not done.
